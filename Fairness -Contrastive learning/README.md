# Steps:
1. Set up the computational environment with PyTorch, torchvision, and numpy installed for machine learning and data handling.

2. Import DenseNet-121 from torchvision's model collection and modify it by removing the final classification layer to serve as the feature extraction backbone.

3. Construct a contrastive head with a fully connected layer outputting 128-dimensional embeddings.

4. Develop a custom function to calculate contrastive loss using the embeddings from the contrastive head.

5. Define image augmentation transformations and establish a function for DICOM to JPG conversion, ensuring images are preprocessed correctly.

6. Implement a custom `Dataset` class capable of loading image triplets and prepare a `DataLoader` to batch and shuffle these triplets during training.

7. Write a training loop that processes the image triplets, calculates contrastive loss, and updates the model weights.

8. Post pretraining, append a projection head and a classification head to the model for the downstream task, and train with binary cross-entropy loss.

9. Create functions to assess the model's performance and fairness through appropriate evaluation metrics.
