# Neural Networks Hands-On Projects
Welcome to the Neural Networks Hands-On Projects repository! ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of hands-on projects designed to complement theoretical learning about neural networks. Each project offers a practical, step-by-step implementation of different neural network concepts using popular frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and more.

## Projects Included:

### 1. Face Emotion Recognition 
PyTorch implementation of 'Deep-Emotion,' a facial expression recognition using attentional convolutional network. This repository provides an end-to-end deep learning solution for facial expression analysis.

Each project includes detailed documentation, code samples, and explanations to help you grasp concepts effectively. Feel free to explore, experiment, and expand upon these projects as you dive deeper into the world of neural networks!

Happy learning and coding! ðŸš€ðŸ§
